## Notes from zoom on 21 September:

- We could award half a point if you get it right on the second guess
- If the whole app was multilingual we would have more to write about in report for target users
- We should justify why we allow unlimited skips, cf. a limited amount per game.
- We can use the English word as a clue - but this won’t help people whose main language is te reo - one of the target users could be kids at Te Kōhanga Reo or Te Kura
- Reward page could (should?) use te reo messages (e.g. ka pai)
- There is a difference between a and ā so it should be wrong, same with hyphens. Valerio says we could show a warning if the answer is only wrong because of a hyphen/macron.
- It should be correct if you use the waikato iwi’s style (ā = aa, Ō = OO etc.). We should justify this.
- Some groups are showing the correct answer once you get it wrong - we should justify why we don’t do this

Project will have a separate “games module” (from A3) and a “practice module”

## Notes from zoom on 5 October:

- With the intro of prac, remove functionality for two guesses?
  - At Least one module with hint capacity - hard requirement
  - With time being a factor, do you want to give hints?
- Requirements for A3 don’t carry over?
  - Yes and No, only ever the one module in A3
  - In the project there is the prac and game module
  - No reason why prac module cant look like A3
  - Anything implemented, don’t strip it out
  - User manual to make clear where the features are
  - If something is out of place, could hide it or make optional
  - You're more likely to be recognised for the functionality, rather than punished than it being there
- You have spelling list of topics numbers 1-10
  - When nasser goes to use the list 2 4 6 8 1
  - Valerio 12352
- Limitless practise module?
  - As long as you can leave when you want, should be fine
