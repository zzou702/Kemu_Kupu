Notes from zoom on 21 September:

- We could award half a point if you get it right on the second guess
- If the whole app was multilingual we would have more to write about in report for target users
- We should justify why we allow unlimited skips, cf. a limited amount per game.
- We can use the English word as a clue - but this won’t help people whose main language is te reo - one of the target users could be kids at Te Kōhanga Reo or Te Kura
- Reward page could (should?) use te reo messages (e.g. ka pai)
- There is a difference between a and ā so it should be wrong, same with hyphens. Valerio says we could show a warning if the answer is only wrong because of a hyphen/macron.
- It should be correct if you use the waikato iwi’s style (ā = aa, Ō = OO etc.). We should justify this.
- Some groups are showing the correct answer once you get it wrong - we should justify why we don’t do this

Project will have a separate “games module” (from A3) and a “practice module”
